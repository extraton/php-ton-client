**Extraton** is a simple and powerful php-library to binding with the [TON SDK](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK). It allows to interact with FreeTON blockchain. It has the rich abilities:

 - All methods of the TON SDK v1.0.0 are implemented
 - Interaction with the TON SDK through an asynchronous calls
 - The every method contains inline-doc
 - The full autocomplete is available in a such IDE like the [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
 - Simple installation by the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager
 - The automatic download of the TON SDK library for the current environment
 - The client auto configuration (out-of-the-box)
 - Covered by the unit-tests
 - Fully covered by the integration tests
 - Tools to maintain code quality (static analyser and codestyle checker) 
 - Tools to the quick start to develop (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) + [Makefile](Makefile))
 - The error handling by the general exception interface (see [src/Exception](src/Exception)) 
 - Using generators to iterate the asynchronous events
 - You can add your own client implementation based on [FFIAdapter](src/FFI/FFIAdapter.php) and [Binding](src/Binding/Binding.php)
 - A simple interface to the graphql requests
 - Temporary logs creation for the detailed analysis on integration tests running

## Requirements
- php7.4+ or php8.0+
- ffi extension
- json extension
- zlib extension
- TON SDK Library __1.21.5__ (download script included)

## Installation
To install it via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) simply run:
``` bash
composer require extraton/php-ton-client
```
To automatically download the TON SDK library add the following lines to your project `composer.json` file:
``` json
...
  "scripts": {
    "download-ton-sdk-library": "Extraton\\TonClient\\Composer\\Scripts::downloadLibrary",
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "@download-ton-sdk-library"
    ],
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "@download-ton-sdk-library"
    ]
  }
...
```
The library will be downloaded after the commands ```composer install``` or ```composer update``` are called in your project root. To forced download the TON SDK library for your operating system, run the following command:
``` bash
composer run download-ton-sdk-library
```
The TON SDK library will be installed to the directory ```YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/vendor/extranton/php-ton-client/bin/```.

## Configuring
Simple TonClient instantiation:
```php
$tonClient = TonClient::createDefault();
```
It uses the default configuration:
```php
$config = [
    "network" => [
        'server_address'             => 'net.ton.dev',
        'network_retries_count'      => 5,
        'message_retries_count'      => 5,
        'message_processing_timeout' => 60000,
        'wait_for_timeout'           => 60000,
        'out_of_sync_threshold'      => 30000,
        'access_key'                 => ''
    ],
    'abi'     => [
        'workchain'                              => 0,
        'message_expiration_timeout'             => 60000,
        'message_expiration_timeout_grow_factor' => 1.35
    ],
    'crypto'  => [
        'mnemonic_dictionary'   => 1,
        'mnemonic_word_count'   => 12,
        'hdkey_derivation_path' => "m/44'/396'/0'/0/0",
        'hdkey_compliant'       => true
    ],
];
```
You can start using a simple configuration for TonClient:
```php
$config = [
    'network' => [
        'server_address' => 'net.ton.dev'
    ]
];
```
All configuration options are available [here](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/1.0.0/docs/mod_client.md#ClientConfig). After instantiate the TonClient will automatically detect operating system and path to the TON SDK library:
```php
// Create new instance with custom configuration and default path to TON SDK library
$tonClient = new TonClient($config);
```
Default path: `YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/vendor/extraton/bin/tonclient.*`. Also you can specify path by the following lines of code:
```php
// Create new instance TonClient with custom path to TON SDK library
$binding = new Binding('PATH_TO_TON_SDK_LIBRARY');
$tonClient = new TonClient($config, $binding);
```
## Basic usage
```php
// Get TON SDK version
$result = $tonClient->version();

echo "TON SDK version: " , $result->getVersion() . PHP_EOL;
```
```php
// Get instance of Crypto module
$crypto = $tonClient->getCrypto();

// Generate random key pair
$result = $crypto->generateRandomSignKeys();
$keyPair = $result->getKeyPair();

echo 'Public key: ' . $keyPair->getPublic() . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Private key: ' . $keyPair->getSecret() . PHP_EOL;
```

```php
// Get instance of Utils module
$utils = $tonClient->getUtils();

// Convert address to hex format
$result = $utils->convertAddressToHex('ee65d170830136253ad8bd2116a28fcbd4ac462c6f222f49a1505d2fa7f7f528');

echo 'Hex: ' . $result->getAddress() . PHP_EOL;
```
## Building queries
Use special classes to easily build queries:
 ```php
$query = (new ParamsOfWaitForCollection('accounts'))
    ->addResultField('id', 'last_paid')
    ->addFilter('last_paid', Filters::IN, [1601332024, 1601331924])
    ->setTimeout(60_000);

$net->waitForCollection($query);
```

```php
$query = (new ParamsOfSubscribeCollection('transactions'))
    ->addResultField('id', 'block_id', 'balance_delta')
    ->addFilter('balance_delta', Filters::GT, '0x5f5e100');
    
$net->subscribeCollection($query);
```

```php
$query = new ParamsOfQueryCollection('accounts');
$query->addResultField(
    'acc_type',
    'acc_type_name',
    'balance',
    'boc',
    'id',
    'last_paid',
    'workchain_id',
);
$query->addFilter(
    'last_paid',
    Filters::IN,
    [
        1601332024,
        1601331924,
        1601332491,
        1601332679
    ]
);
$query->addOrderBy('last_paid', OrderBy::DESC)->setLimit(2);

$net->queryCollection($query);
```
You can add your own query class that implements the interface `\Extraton\TonClient\Entity\Net\QueryInterface` or extends the class `\Extraton\TonClient\Entity\Net\AbstractQuery`.

The following constants are available for filters and directions:
```php
class Filters implements Params
{
    public const EQ = 'eq';
    public const GE = 'ge';
    public const GT = 'gt';
    public const IN = 'in';
    public const LE = 'le';
    public const LT = 'lt';
    public const NE = 'ne';
    public const NOT_IN = 'notIn';
...
```
```php
class OrderBy implements Params
{
    public const ASC = 'ASC';
    public const DESC = 'DESC';
...
```
## Advanced usage
Use the following example to build an application for monitoring events coming from the blockchain network:
```php
// Build query
$query = (new ParamsOfSubscribeCollection('transactions'))
    ->addResultField('id', 'block_id', 'balance_delta')
    ->addFilter('balance_delta', Filters::GT, '0x5f5e100');

// Get result with handle and start watching
$result = $net->subscribeCollection($query);

echo "Handle: {$result->getHandle()}." . PHP_EOL;

$counter = 0;

// Iterate generator
foreach ($result->getIterator() as $event) {
    $counter++;

    echo "Event counter: {$counter}, event data:" . PHP_EOL;
    var_dump($event->getResult());

    if ($counter > 25) {
        echo 'Manual stop watching.' . PHP_EOL;
        $result->stop(); // or call: $net->unsubscribe($result->getHandle());
    }
}

echo 'Finished.' . PHP_EOL;
  ```

## Examples
Please see [Examples](examples) and [Integration tests](tests/Integration) for more information on detailed usage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
We use experemental [PHP extension FFI](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ffi.php). This extension allows the loading of shared libraries, calling of C functions and accessing of C data structures in pure PHP. **This is the only one possible way to async integrate with the TON SDK library.**

Please read **the official warnings** from the developers of php:
>Warning
>This extension is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this extension including the names of its functions and any other documentation surrounding this extension may change without notice in a future release of PHP. This extension should be used at your own risk.

[FFI Introduction](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.ffi.php)

> Although this works, this functionality is not supported on all libffi platforms, is not efficient and leaks resources by the end of request.

[PHP Callbacks](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ffi.examples-callback.php)

We have not detected memory leaks. But sometimes we caught segmentation faults during testing. üôè Hopefully the FFI extension will be stabilized in future versions of php.
## Change log
Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.

## Testing
Run the following command to run unit tests:
``` bash
make test-unit
```
... and integration tests:
```bash
make test-integration
```
Some tests use TON SDK methods that listen for asynchronous events. Data from these events is saved to the directory `/tests/Integration/artifacts/`. This way you can analyze them in detail. For example, the test `\Extraton\Tests\Integration\TonClient\ProcessingTest::testProcessMessageWithEvents` uses the call of method `\Extraton\TonClient\Processing::processMessage`. Events received during generator iteration are saved in a file.

## Code Quality
We use [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to control code quality. Run the following commands to analyze the code and fix code style errors:
```bash
make analyze
```
```bash
make codestyle
```
```bash
make codestyle-fix
```
